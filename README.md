# countdown
a minimal tool for calculating time-difference between now and then, with optional visualization

Key features:
- timer
- countdown
- nice disappearing blocks that represent days, minutes or seconds
- uses cookies to save your timer or countdown
- does not contain any ads or tracking
- works on mobile

I wrote this because I want to have an equivalent to crossing boxes on the calender for adults. <br>
And I wanted it without ads. I added the visualization because I wanted to learn about the use of canvas anyways.
